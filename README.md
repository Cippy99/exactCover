This is a project made for the course "Algoritmi e Strutture Dati" at University of Brescia.

This is a set of programs to generate and solve [Exact Cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover) probems.

The goal of the project was to evaluate the performance of the given algorithm.

## Usage

This is a CLI program written in Python. 

The solving algotirhm has a base and a plus version. `EC.py` implements both versions of the solving algorithm. For more information about it's usage run `EC.py -h`.

`fileGenerator.py` is used to generate random Exact Cover problems while `outputCheck.py` is used to verify that both base and plus versions of the algorithm produce the same output.
